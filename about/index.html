        Hey, I am Wang Yang, a front-end programmer for mobile games. I have a wide variety of interest about games, RPG, ACT, FPS, RTS, MOBA, etc. I started coding since high school, and I have the ability to learn fast, which greatly help me in the fast growing game development industry.

        I also have interest in music. I joined an A Cappella group in high school, and taught myself about arrangement, recording and mixing. There are also a couple of works about our group in this site.
