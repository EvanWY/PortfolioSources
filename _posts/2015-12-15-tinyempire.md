### Experience

This was the first time I worked in a commercial game project. Our lead designer, programmer, artist and producer were very professional with average 8 years of game development experience. I learned a lot from them. 

* **Development Process.** I learn about roles in the team, include concept artist, animation artist, UI artist, system designer, story designer, data balance designer, level designer, etc.

* **Periodic Maintenance.** We updated the game weekly, we have schedules, and we stick to the schedules. I used to work in another game of similar size and the development speed was slow even though we worked 12 hours a day, because this game project is always planless.

* **Extreme attention to details.** This was the biggest difference between commercial game and my own games. For example,  The "send" button in the chat panel was describe by 2 pages of design document, all special cases were fully discussed.
