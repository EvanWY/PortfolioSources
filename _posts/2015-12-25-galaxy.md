Galaxy is an idle strategic game. Player manage a space fleet with one to eight ships. The fleet keep searching and fighting enemy automatically, even when the player is offline. Player may customize their ships and weapons. My main responsibility is front-end programming, I also help UI design and battle design.

* **Tools**: Cocos2D, Lua

###Responsibilities

###Challenges

####Battle code framework 

For security, we compute battle in server, and send the process detail and result to front-end for display. I use finite state machine to ensure maintainability. I impelemented a 

``` lua

state.TravelFinish = function(nextCountdown)
	--state actions
	sendTravelFinish()

	-- state transition
	transition(state.CheckGain, CONST.BATTLE.TRAVELFINISH_TO_CHECKGAIN, {nextCountdown})
