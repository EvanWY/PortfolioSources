This game is a MMORPG with a side-scrolling battle system on mobile platforms. Player act as a character who is learning about battle in a Demon Hunting School. We use Unity 3D and C# in this game. 

###Responsibilities 

I quickly took part in the development after one or two weeks of studying about Unity 3D. I started with bug fixing and small modifications. Later, I built some complete system. I am currently working on the storytelling system and PC version of the game.

*Windows PC version
*Activity System
*Clan System

###Challenges 

I was given the task to design and implement the storytelling system which moves camera and characters to film scenes, and display dialogues during the playback.

The storytelling system was a entirely new system in the game. No similar function has ever been added to this game. Therefore, biggest problem in this task is not the technical implementation, but to figure out how the system look like. This requires me to understand the designers' purposes, abstract a program procedures about "scene" and "shot", design the configuration parameters, and teach designers about them.
