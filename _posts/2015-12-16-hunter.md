###Story Scene System

My task was to design and implement Story Scene System which moves camera and characters to film scenes, and display dialogues during the playback.

**Problems**

* Entirely new system, no similar system before
* Complex logic of playback sequence
* Nontechnical user (User is the designers)

**Solutions**

* Discussed with designers to understand the requirement
* Abstract a program procedures correspond to the logic of Story Scene steps
* Designed a configuration to control the camera movement and scene change
* Taught designers and solve new problems 

	*__e.g.__ I use the camera position and camera target position to define the movement at first, but later I knew that It is not very easy to understand without solid space geometry knowledge. So I changes the program to use camera position and camera rotation as parameters, which were much easier to obtain.*

**Result** 

* Successfully created a powerful system which was easy to use and works well. Some features is listed here:
	* A scene is split into "stages". When a stage end, the following stage start.
	* A stage has 2 independent "sequences", the dialogue sequence and the camera sequence. The stage end when both sequence end.
	* Dialogue sequence is driven by user clicking.
	* Camera sequence is driven by playback time.
	* Camera sequence contains camera and character motions. These motions is configured with specific position, angle, start time, duration, speed and animation.
* Story Scene System Screenshots
